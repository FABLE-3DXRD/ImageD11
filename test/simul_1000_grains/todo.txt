- scripts/makemap.py
- this code sandbox/fittrans
- ImageD11/indeder.py : indexer.refine

TO DO:
   Improve indexing to be faster (single script with simple run through)

    compare results (currently makemap is the only one that works on simul1000)
    ... probably due to better peak assignments ? Try taking these ...

    implement a version which replaces h/k/l or gx/gy/gz error with:
        |g|, omega, azimuth
        Fitting in U.B, translation
          |g| (or theta or twotheta) depends on B, translation but not U
          omega depends on U.B but not translation 
          azimuth depends on U.B and translation
