Overhaul or new package?

peaksearcher:
  return to image-by-image processing
    background?  
      pixels at radius / azimuth. Assume azimuth doesn't matter.
      Histogram of intensity values (different intensities) at each tth
       ... characterize this distribution
         - tail = Bragg peaks
         - azimuthal components?
      powder1D with a few fourier components in azimuth
  record pixel labelling for peaks
  merge across frames in nDimensions and more intelligent overlaps
    (fraction of pixels in peak, central part of intensity)

Geometry:
  General purpose package - look at GREWGG
  Geometry of transations+rotations is in both ImageCIF and NeXus

Indexing:
  Identification of scattering vectors / g-vectors as groups of peaks:
    h, -h, 2h, -2h,  h@180, ...
  Known unit cells (angles between g or grainspotter)
    assigned to 2theta rings
  Unknown (index_unknown code)
    using 2theta rings and typical powder methods
    additional zone searching information from 3D

Refinement:
  Geometrical for strains from far-field
    Diffractometer zeros, camera distortions
  Intensities (point groups needed)
    Rint, Rmerge
  Difftomo for grain shapes





# 23-3-2017

Moved the repository to github.com/jonwright

Started work on a spring cleaning...

  - sort out the testsuites
  - sort out the documentation (e.g. sphinx)
  - try to update pyPI
  ...


# 19-3-2013

Need to make a some spring cleaning
 - remove bbfreeze, py2exe
 - put test files into svn ignores
 - make testsuites and clean up testing
 - etc



# 20-11-08

Reduce and then fix the duplicate peak issue in peaksearch
Sort out the omega error bars in peaksearch
Have another look at makemap performance with >500 grains and >50000K peaks...


# 3-3-08
To Add with some cleaning: 
   filterout.py	-  removes grains from flt files
   makemap.py	-  fitgrain/filtergrain pairs
   xyz_rod.py   -  convert map output
   make_uniq.py  - flip ubifiles according to symmetry
		 ... bugfix hexagonal case, etc




Module docs and functions and function docs from compiled extensions


run makedocs in doc subdir as part of setup.py build ??


Separation of gui from useful code to be completed:

"Some people are  naturally  more  comfortable with point-n-shoot 
GUI interfaces.  Some of us old retrograde dinosaurs imagine GUIs 
to be a place to run  multiple xterms  so we can use the keyboard 
even more."        Tim Daneliuk, in comp.lang.python, 16 Jun 2006
