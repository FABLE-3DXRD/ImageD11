"""This code came from skimage.transform and then was modified 

- Added mask ROI for back projection. Optimisation for small grains
  in big maps. Should allow threading (one thread per tile)
  
- Added projection shifts (sinogram shaped array of dty shifts). 
  Should work the same way for both forward and back projection. 
  Probably only for small offsets

    From skimage.transform. Modified to have projection shifts and roi
    to match the masked iradon here
    
    Calculates the radon transform of an image given specified
    projection angles.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : array_like
        Input image. The rotation axis will be located in the pixel with
        indices ``(image.shape[0] // 2, image.shape[1] // 2)``.
    theta : array_like
        Projection angles (in degrees).
    output_size : shape of the output sinogram. Matches [:, len(theta)]

    Returns
    -------
    radon_image : ndarray
        Radon transform (sinogram).  The tomography rotation axis will lie
        at the pixel index ``radon_image.shape[0] // 2`` along the 0th
        dimension of ``radon_image``.
