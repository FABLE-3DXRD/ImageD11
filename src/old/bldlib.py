We started using some intrinsics in the C code to make it run faster
when processors support specific instructions.  This makes it less
portable and harder to build. These notes explain how things could 
work. 

If a CPU has some feature (sse2, avx2, fma, etc) then we will want
to use it in specific places that we are aware of. We might as well
also let the compiler use those instructions everywhere else where
we have not written specific things too. That means:

- compile everything as avx2 -> avx2 version
- compile everything as sse2 -> sse2 version
- compile everything as ansi -> ansi version

So we are going to build a series of extensions and use #ifdef inside
them.

-- May 2020 - all that gets to be a horrific mess.
We have a "generic" build that takes the regular python option
and a host platform build that take -mhost=native flags.

Which one we get is determined by the cImageD11.py module.
